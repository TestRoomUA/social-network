# social-network
this is my old unfinished social network

The whole project is written by me in HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. 
Using bootstrap library and ORM RedBeanPHP.

The project initially worked on the domain and had a database, after the domain stopped working and the project worked only on the local WAMP server. To test the project on your computer, download this repository and install the WAMP server. Then change the data in the dp.php file in "host", "dbname", "login" and "password" fields and run the project on the WAMP server.

It could be helpful to seek assistance from someone knowledgeable in running a local server on a computer or connecting to a local database if you are unfamiliar with these tasks.
